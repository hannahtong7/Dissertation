Title:
CO₂–Temperature Interactions in the Marine Diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii: Multi-Genotype Growth Response Surfaces for Trait-Based Models
MSc Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity, University of Edinburgh (2024–2025)
Project Overview
This study investigates how carbon dioxide (CO₂) and temperature interact to influence population growth and physiology in two warm-water genotypes of the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. Using a continuous CO₂ × temperature response surface design, we generated the first genotype-specific CO₂–temperature performance curves within a shared thermal niche.
Key Objectives
Characterise CO₂–growth response curves across three temperatures using a Bayesian Eilers–Peeters model.
Assess intraspecific variation in CO₂–temperature interactions to determine whether responses are conserved or strain-specific.
Provide empirical parameters for improving ecological and biogeochemical model predictions under future ocean conditions.
Methods Summary
Design: 6 CO₂ levels (100–1000 µatm) × 3 temperatures (26, 30, 35 °C) × 2 genotypes
Culture conditions: Nutrient-replete, light-saturating, closed-system incubations
Measurements:
Specific growth rate (μ) via cell counts
Carbonate chemistry via pH + TA
Chlorophyll-a content
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence
Analysis: Bayesian non-linear regression (Eilers–Peeters model) in R (brms package)# Dissertation
